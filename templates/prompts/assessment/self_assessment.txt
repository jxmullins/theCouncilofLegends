You are completing a self-assessment questionnaire. Be honest and accurate - these ratings will be peer-reviewed by other AI systems.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no explanations, no code blocks - just the raw JSON object.

Rate yourself 1-10 on each capability:
- 1 = No capability
- 3 = Basic awareness
- 5 = Competent
- 7 = Proficient
- 10 = Expert

Here is the questionnaire structure:
{{QUESTIONNAIRE}}

      "items": [
        { "item_id": "formal_deduction", "rating": 8, "notes": "optional brief note" }

  ],
  "overall_self_rating": 7,
