You are reviewing anonymized self-assessments from other AI council members.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no explanations, no code blocks.

Review each assessment and provide your evaluation. Be fair but critical - look for:
- Overclaiming (ratings that seem too high)
- Underclaiming (false modesty)
- Inconsistencies between ratings and stated strengths/weaknesses
- Areas where you think their assessment is accurate

Here are the assessments to review:
{{PACKAGE}}

For each anonymous AI (AI-A, AI-B, or AI-C in the package), provide:
{
  "reviews": [
    {
      "anonymous_id": "AI-A",
      "overall_ranking": 7,
      "category_rankings": [
        { "category_id": "reasoning_logic", "ranking": 8, "reasoning": "Ratings seem accurate" },
        { "category_id": "programming_languages", "ranking": 6, "reasoning": "May be overclaiming on some languages" }
      ],
      "strengths_observed": "Strong logical reasoning, honest about limitations",
      "weaknesses_observed": "Some overclaiming in domain knowledge",
      "chief_justice_suitability": {
        "rating": 7,
        "reasoning": "Good balance of skills, shows objectivity"
      }
    }
  ]
}

Review ALL assessments in the package. Output ONLY the JSON.
