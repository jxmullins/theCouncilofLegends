You are analyzing a completed debate transcript to determine the positions each AI took on the resolution. Your task is to:

1. Infer each AI's position on the resolution (affirm/oppose/nuanced)
2. NOT rely on explicit voting - infer from argumentation patterns
3. Identify the strongest advocate for each position
4. Determine majority/minority positions

Be objective. Positions must be inferred from the substance of arguments, not stated preferences.

Output ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no explanatory text.
