Analyze this debate and infer positions.

RESOLUTION: {{RESOLUTION}}

DEBATE TRANSCRIPT:
{{TRANSCRIPT}}

For each AI (claude, codex, gemini), determine:
- Their position: "affirm" (supports resolution), "oppose" (against resolution), or "nuanced" (mixed/unclear)
- Confidence in that inference (0.0-1.0)
- Their key contribution to that position

Then determine:
- Vote tally (how many affirm vs oppose vs nuanced)
- Majority position (affirm or oppose, whichever has more)
- Best advocate for majority position
- Best advocate for minority position (if any)
