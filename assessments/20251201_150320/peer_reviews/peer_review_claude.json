Chief Justice requires exceptional objectivity and self-awareness. The multiple 9-10 ratings in subjective areas, combined with weaker legal/ethical foundations (6-7), suggest this candidate may lack the balanced judgment needed. Good technical advisor, but insufficient legal grounding and potential overconfidence in deliberative skills"

Constitutional interpretation rating of 5 shows intellectual honesty crucial for judicial role. No perfect 10s anywhere suggests realistic understanding of limitations.
