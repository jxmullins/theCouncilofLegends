The absence of notes makes it challenging to discern genuine depth of understanding and raises concerns about potential overclaiming in areas like communication, science/technology, and crediting sources. This lack of critical self-analysis, particularly in comparison to a more transparent peer, somewhat diminishes its suitability for a role requiring significant judgment and objectivity."
