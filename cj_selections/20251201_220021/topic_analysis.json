    {"category_id": "reasoning_logic", "relevance": 0.8, "reasoning": "The debate requires logical comparison and evaluation of the two programming languages, making reasoning and logic highly relevant."},
    {"category_id": "legal_ethical", "relevance": 0.0, "reasoning": "There's no apparent legal or ethical dimension to the comparison of Rust and Go for systems programming, making this category irrelevant."},
    {"category_id": "argumentation", "relevance": 0.8, "reasoning": "Debaters need to construct compelling arguments to support their preferred language, making argumentation highly relevant."},
    {"category_id": "domain_knowledge", "relevance": 0.8, "reasoning": "In-depth knowledge of systems programming, Rust, and Go is crucial for a meaningful comparison, making domain knowledge highly relevant."},
    {"category_id": "programming_languages", "relevance": 1.0, "reasoning": "The topic is centered around programming languages, specifically Rust and Go, making this category essential."},
    {"category_id": "accessibility_inclusive_design", "relevance": 0.0, "reasoning": "Accessibility and inclusive design are not directly relevant to the comparison of Rust and Go for systems programming."},
    {"category_id": "communication", "relevance": 0.7, "reasoning": "Effective communication is necessary to convey the advantages and disadvantages of each language, but it's not as central as other categories."},
    {"category_id": "meta_cognition", "relevance": 0.6, "reasoning": "While self-awareness of one's own knowledge and biases can be helpful, it's not as directly relevant to the technical comparison at hand."},
    {"category_id": "collaboration", "relevance": 0.4, "reasoning": "Collaboration might be somewhat relevant if the debate involves teamwork or integrating feedback, but it's not a primary aspect of the topic."}],

  "analysis_notes": "This analysis focuses on the technical aspects of comparing Rust and Go for systems programming, highlighting the importance of domain knowledge, programming languages, and argumentation."
