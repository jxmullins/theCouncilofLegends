    {"category_id": "reasoning_logic", "relevance": 0.8, "reasoning": "The decision to migrate from REST to GraphQL requires evaluating the pros and cons of each approach, considering factors like scalability, maintainability, and performance, which demands strong reasoning and logical thinking."},

    {"category_id": "argumentation", "relevance": 0.8, "reasoning": "To convince stakeholders of the migration's benefits or drawbacks, one must construct compelling arguments, considering various perspectives and potential outcomes, which is central to effective argumentation."},
    {"category_id": "domain_knowledge", "relevance": 0.9, "reasoning": "A deep understanding of both REST and GraphQL, including their architectures, use cases, and limitations, is essential for making an informed decision about migrating the backend."},
    {"category_id": "programming_languages", "relevance": 0.9, "reasoning": "The migration involves technical considerations about how data will be structured, queried, and managed, which is heavily dependent on programming languages and their ecosystems."},
    {"category_id": "accessibility_inclusive_design", "relevance": 0.1, "reasoning": "While accessibility is important in software development, the choice between REST and GraphQL is more about backend architecture and less directly about accessibility or inclusive design principles."},
