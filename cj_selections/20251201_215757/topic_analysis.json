    {"category_id": "argumentation", "relevance": 0.8, "reasoning": "The debate involves presenting arguments for or against each language, which requires effective argumentation skills."},
    {"category_id": "domain_knowledge", "relevance": 0.8, "reasoning": "In-depth knowledge of systems programming and the characteristics of Rust and Go is essential for a meaningful comparison."},
    {"category_id": "programming_languages", "relevance": 1.0, "reasoning": "The topic is centered around programming languages, specifically Rust and Go, making this category essential."},
    {"category_id": "accessibility_inclusive_design", "relevance": 0.0, "reasoning": "Accessibility and inclusive design are not directly relevant to the comparison of Rust and Go for systems programming."},
    {"category_id": "communication", "relevance": 0.7, "reasoning": "Effective communication is necessary to articulate the advantages and disadvantages of each language in the context of systems programming."},
    {"category_id": "meta_cognition", "relevance": 0.6, "reasoning": "Reflection on one's own knowledge and biases about programming languages can be beneficial but is not as critical as other categories."},
    {"category_id": "collaboration", "relevance": 0.4, "reasoning": "While collaboration might be useful in discussing the merits of each language, it is not a primary aspect of the debate topic itself."}],

  "analysis_notes": "The comparison between Rust and Go for systems programming heavily relies on technical knowledge and the ability to argue for or against each language based on their characteristics and the needs of systems programming."
